# JANIF
An app for tracking scores in the card game Janif

## About
Janif is a variant of the game Yaniv, with some added rules and player powerups that allow for a more dynamic game progression. With the tagline "Anything can turn around", the game allows for players to correct past mistakes and turn a losing streak into a victory.

Because of the many rules that affect scoring, the Janif app was made to ease the tracking of players' score and powerups. It also provided a testing ground for React and Redux.
